🚀 *AI-Powered Personalized Research & Decision-Making Agent*  
(Built with Python, FastAPI, Streamlit, Hugging Face, FAISS, & more)

Tired of information overload? I built an *AI system that does the research for you*!
🔍 It collects the latest *news, research papers, and social media content, then uses **AI/NLP to summarize and present it in a beautiful dashboard* — so you can make smart decisions fast.

💡 *Who is it for?*  
✔ Professionals who need quick insights  
✔ Researchers tracking real-time trends  
✔ Businesses needing competitive intel  

🎯 *Why it’s powerful:*  
- Real-time data scraping  
- Semantic search with vector embeddings  
- Trend summarization  
- Clean Streamlit dashboard

- 💼 I built this end-to-end, and everything runs locally with a few simple commands.  
✅ Backend: uvicorn main:app --reload  
✅ Frontend: streamlit run app.py
